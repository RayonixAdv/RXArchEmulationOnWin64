# Why is the clock speed of the emulator so slow?
###### Answer
Emulators are incredibly resource intensive. This is because emulators are not running software on the intended platform, to trick the software into thinking its running nativly, it requires emulation of all networks in a machine, communication protocols and other critical processes.
###### Solution
Overclock your system, ensure your graphics connection from the emulator is stable, if your device runs on a battery, try pluging it in.
